I have locked in on a process with nunjucks to create nested grids using macros.

06/03/19 2hrs creating a layout with nunjucks

I spent a couple of hours trying to get a process together which would output the layout I desired. It has been quite a slow process and I need to get my head into a pattern with nunchucks that would enable a nested layout to be created.

I can see straight away that the necessity of pre-built components, will really help speed up the process.

05/03/19 30mins Finishing mapping layout

cleared up issue with the footer structure to ensure it works responsively

I used a quick layout in Affinity designer to visualise my approach together.

04/03/19 Mapping out layout

I started to map the structure of the layout. This process helped me to quickly identify a couple of areas that needed attention.
