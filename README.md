Added nunjucks to the project

06/03/19 2hrs creating a layout with nunjucks

I spent a couple of hours trying to get a process together which would output the layout I desired. It has been quite a slow process and I need to get my head into a pattern with nunchucks that would enable a nested layout to be created.

I can see straight away that the necessity of pre-built components, will really help speed up the process.

cleared up issue with the footer structure to ensure it works responsively

I used a quick layout in Affinity designer to visualise my approach together.
