Added nunjucks to the project

08/03/19 1hr Yo Yo Yo!

Basically I re-did the project code base using Yeoman to help flesh out the project.
I have created template files for those common components.
There are macros for generating nested HTML grid layouts.
The process was definatly smoother as opposed to manually creating the code or copying and pasting.

I have locked in on a process with nunjucks to create nested grids using macros.

06/03/19 2hrs creating a layout with nunjucks

I spent a couple of hours trying to get a process together which would output the layout I desired. It has been quite a slow process and I need to get my head into a pattern with nunchucks that would enable a nested layout to be created.

I can see straight away that the necessity of pre-built components, will really help speed up the process.

05/03/19 30mins Finishing mapping layout

cleared up issue with the footer structure to ensure it works responsively

I used a quick layout in Affinity designer to visualise my approach together.

04/03/19 Mapping out layout

I started to map the structure of the layout. This process helped me to quickly identify a couple of areas that needed attention.
